## OPEN Platform: A distributed network for the Smart Contracts

OPEN Platform uses blockchain technology to leverages smart contracts
for autonomously managed digital assets to create a "smart economy"
within a decentralized network.

### Supported Platforms

We already support the following platforms:

* Docker
* macOS 10 +
* Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 14.10, Ubuntu 15.04, Ubuntu 15.10, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10
* Windows 7 SP1 +, Windows Server 2008 R2 +

### Running

To run peer applications, you need to download client application
for a specific operating system and run.

### How to Contribute

You can contribute to OPEN Platform with issues and PRs. Simply filing issues
for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing
implementations is greatly appreciated.

We use and recommend the following workflow:

1. Create an issue for your work.
    * You can skip this step for trivial changes.
    * Reuse an existing issue on the topic, if there is one.
    * Clearly state that you are going to take on implementing it,
    if that's the case. You can request that the issue be assigned to
    you. Note: The issue filer and the implementer don't have to be the
    same person.
2. Create a personal fork of the repository on GitHub (if you don't
already have one).

3. Create a branch off of master(git checkout -b mybranch).
    * Name the branch so that it clearly communicates your intentions,
    such as issue-88 or peer-to-peer-issue.
    * Branches are useful since they isolate your changes from incoming
    changes from upstream. They also enable you to create multiple PRs
    from the same fork.
4. Make and commit your changes.
5. Add new tests corresponding to your change, if applicable.
6. Build the repository with your changes.
    * Make sure that the builds are clean.
    * Make sure that the tests are all passing, including your new tests.
7. Create a pull request (PR) against the upstream repository's master branch.
    * Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

Note: It is OK for your PR to include a large number of commits.
Once your change is accepted, you will be asked to squash your commits
into one or some appropriately small number of commits before your PR is merged.
